## What is the sliding window technique?

The sliding window technique is a method for solving problems involving arrays or lists, especially those that require examining or processing a subset of contiguous elements.

The technique can optimize the performance by turning two nested loops in a single loop reducing the complexity from O(nÂ²) to O(n) in many cases.

### Concept

To use the sliding window technique you create two pointers, one to the start of the window, and one at the end.

By moving these pointers you can slide the window over the array, making the needed calculations as you go. In a fixed width window the pointers always move at the same time.
